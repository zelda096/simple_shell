A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter

## Estructure
this project is focused on creating a shell from 0 that provides a command line user interface for unix operating systems.

this shell prototype is similar to the one that comes by default in our linux operating system.

Here is our list of commands you can use with our shell:

| Comands | Descriptions |
|---------|--------------|
|   n     |  n  n,n  ,n  |
|         |              |
|         |              |
|         |              |

### How to install?

to make the installation of this shell we will make:
```
* Clone the repository
* go to the "clone or download" button.
* Copy the url from the repository.
* Open the command terminal.
* Use the command "git clone" followed by the url.
```
additionally you give enter later to copy the repository in your command terminal and there they will have this shell.
